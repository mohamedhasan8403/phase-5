# 🤖 Project: AI-EBPL – Autonomous Vehicles & Robotics 🚀

> 🚗 **AI-Enhanced Behavioral Planning & Localization System for Smart Mobility** 🚦

This project delivers a **modular and intelligent system** to enhance autonomous vehicle behavior and robotic control. It uses **AI models**, **sensor fusion**, and **real-time path planning** to simulate, analyze, and optimize navigation in both **structured** (bustling urban landscapes like Chennai's streets) and **unstructured** (the varied terrain outside the city) environments.

### ✨ Key Features

- 🤖 **Autonomous Navigation**: AI-based route optimization and decision-making for obstacle avoidance, adapting to the flow of traffic like navigating Mount Road during rush hour. 🚶‍♀️🚧
- 🧠 **Sensor Fusion**: Combines data from **LiDAR** <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/Vg4AXx5VGc5VAUfz9B/giphy.gif" width="30" alt="LiDAR Icon">, **ultrasonic**, **GPS** 🛰️, and **camera** 📸 sensors for a robust environmental understanding, just like a seasoned Chennai driver uses all their senses.
- 🛣️ **Dynamic Path Planning**: Continuously recalculates navigation paths in real-time based on environment and sensor input, swiftly adjusting to unexpected auto-rickshaws or wandering cows. 🐄
- 🚧 **Traffic & Obstacle Detection**: ML models detect and classify objects like traffic signals <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/YnJjKz0KOrhQQ/giphy.gif" width="30" alt="Traffic Light Icon">, pedestrians 🚶‍♂️, and barriers for responsive movement, crucial for navigating crowded market areas.
- 🌍 **Simulation Environment**: Simulates both urban (think a digital replica of T. Nagar) and off-road environments for safe and effective algorithm testing. 🏞️
