# 🤖 Project: AI-EBPL – Autonomous Vehicles & Robotics       

> 🚗 **AI-Enhanced Behavioral Planning & Localization System for Smart Mobility**

This project delivers a **modular and intelligent system** to enhance autonomous vehicle behavior and robotic control. It uses **AI models**, **sensor fusion**, and **real-time path planning** to simulate, analyze, and optimize navigation in both **structured** (bustling urban landscapes like Chennai's streets) and **unstructured** (the varied terrain outside the city) environments.

### ✨ Key Features

- 🤖 **Autonomous Navigation**: AI-based route optimization and decision-making for obstacle avoidance, adapting to the flow of traffic like navigating a busy T. Nagar intersection.
- 🧠 **Sensor Fusion**: Combines data from **LiDAR**, **ultrasonic**, **GPS** 🛰️, and **camera** 📸 sensors for a robust environmental understanding.
- 🛣️ **Dynamic Path Planning**: Continuously recalculates navigation paths in real-time based on environment and sensor input, smoothly maneuvering around unexpected roadblocks.
- 🚧 **Traffic & Obstacle Detection**: ML models detect and classify objects like traffic signals, pedestrians 🚶‍♂️, and barriers for responsive movement.
- 🌍 **Simulation Environment**: Simulates both urban and off-road environments for safe and effective algorithm testing.
